# WinClean-GUI

A powerful system maintenance and cleanup utility for Windows, rebuilt with a modern and intuitive graphical user interface inspired by Windows 11's Fluent Design.

This project takes a functional command-line script and elevates it into a user-friendly desktop application, making system maintenance tasks easier and more accessible for everyone.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Intuitive Interface**: A clean and modern UI that is easy to navigate.
- **Selective Cleaning**: Choose exactly what you want to clean:
  - Desktop
  - Temporary Files (`%TEMP%`)
  - AppData Folders (`Roaming` & `Local`)
- **System Tools Integration**:
  - Empty the Recycle Bin with a single click.
  - Launch Windows Disk Cleanup (`cleanmgr.exe`).
  - Run the Disk Defragmenter and Optimizer (`defrag.exe`).
- **Safe and Transparent**: The application requires administrative privileges only for necessary tasks and logs all operations for review.
- **Built with Python**: Developed using Python and the powerful PySide6 framework for the GUI.
